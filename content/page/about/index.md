*pmosCODE* is my site about different topics but mainly about coding, woodworking and 3D printing.

I'm an software engineer in NodeJS, Python and Java.
Woodworking and 3D printing is my hobby beside computers. I live in northern Germany.
Big words are not my strength so that's all about me ... for now.

Where possible, I try to share my everything about my projects.
