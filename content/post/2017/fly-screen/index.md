A few days ago my wife asked my to buy some fly screens for the main window in our living room.

My answer: No. I will do it myself. So some measurements laterâ€¦

I had a plan how it could be done. The windows size is 2.30 x 1.20 meters. It is divided into three parts: 0.60, 1.10 , 0.60.
My plan was to build it out of construction wood. So I measured the wood into two 2.30 and four 1.20 parts. The joints consist of overlapping wood.

The wooden frame was glued together and tightened with screws. When this was done everything was painted brown.
Now the main part of the fly screen had to be assembled.
I ordered a fly screen out of fiberglass (1.50 x 5.00 meters on Amazon).
I straightened the fly screen over the wooden frame and fixed it with staples.

After I had everything fixed I cut off the overlapping fly screen.
Then I added four wires to the inner frame (two on the right side and two on the left side) to be able to tie the fly screen to the window.
I didn't want to drill holes into the walls.
