My first contribution will be the realization of a "French Cleat" system, which has found its place in our storage room.

Since this is quite small and you can really only turn around your own axis, I did not want to mount any fixed shelves.

It should be flexibel - thus adaptable to the respective situation - but if possible use the space well.

Since I already knew the French cleat system, the idea ripened in me: That should be …

Since this was my first project and I had the idea for this kind of documentation later, the making is not documented.
Only the result I can show here. :(

# What is French Cleat?

*French Cleat* is actually a very simple construction, which utilize physics:

![French cleat perspective view](img/F-Cleat-Perspektive.gif "French cleat perspective view") ![French cleat side view](img/F-Cleat-side.jpg "French cleat side view")

Due to the fact that the two *cleats*, ie the angled bars, wedge into one another, the whole guy is "bomb-proof".
The physics - more precisely, the gravitational force - is in this case the "TNT".
The heavier the object that hangs there, the tighter is the seat of the *cleats*. However, it can be resolved without much effort.

The only thing to note is that the heavier the object to be held, the more stable wood should be used for the cleats.

# Buildup

Each of the three chambers should have such a cleat system. The main use of the chamber is: shoes.
For this purpose, I measured the average height of a pair of shoes and set this as the distance between the cleat strips mounted on the wall:

<span style="padding-left: 30px;">30 cm</span>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

I could calculate how many cleats I can bring to the wall. There were six, since I did not want to mount them all the way to the ground.
There should be room for drinks crates or something different.

After that, I had the idea that there should be two types of shoe shelves with different widths:

* 28 cm
* 14 cm

Now it's time to build these shelves:

Thereto I needed per shelf:

* 3 timber beams
* 2 triangles (therefor I cut a rectangle diagonally) out of compressed wood

I then put them together to form a shelf and finished with a cleat. The result: About 10 shelves with the two different widths.

But this is not the end of the flagpole. There will be other cleat elements:

* Hooks
* Trays
* Clips
* …

In the lower area I will also create areas where drinks, crates and others will find place.

It tooks me 2 days of work - each about 4 hours. A nice side effect of the whole thing: It still smells of wood in the chamber even after weeks … gorgeous.
