This is my first try to get a feeling what it means to develop a game with a game engine...

<!--more-->

Game description:

_"This is a small game about one guy who woke up and finds himself in a dungeon full of monsters.
He has no weapons but fortunately the dungeon is full of traps and items.
Your goal is to kill the monsters using the environment of the dungeon..."_

The Story:

I've always wanted to know what it means to develop a game. No matter if using a game engine or not.  
By chance I came across [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). Godot is an open source game engine.
I never tried Unity or the Unreal engine to make a comparison of the three. So, I cannot say which one is better.

Everything looked good, but how the hell to start?  
Answer: YouTube, a lot of YouTube Godot tutorials and HowTo's.

After what felt like 50 videos, I dared to develop and implement a game idea.
But before that, I tried to get a feeling for Godot by implementing a simple platformer game.
It was "a nice try"... And it showed me that it could get (very) complex.  
But after even more YouTube videos I got to work...

With the help of the tutorial videos and my own investigation it was less painful as expected.
Over time, I became faster and more confident with Godot. The main challenge is to get familiar with the node types and
of course with GDScript (I didn't use C# here). But if you ever have used Python in your life, you will feel very familiar here.

So...

I learned a lot. The most important lesson, however, is:
A neat organization of the scenes (including communication among each other) and content (players, enemies, environment).
But, among us, it hasn't quite worked out yet...

But at the time of writing, I already have two more ideas that I'm going to implement. Then the things learned will be fully implemented.

Enough words...
