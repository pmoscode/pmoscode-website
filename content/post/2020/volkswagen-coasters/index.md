Inspired by the model [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:270704), I wanted to recreate the coasters.

But the Volkswagen logo has changed, so I didn't want to print the coasters with the old one ...

<!--more-->

This meant that while I had the container for the coasters and the outer ring, the inner logo had to be replaced.
I searched for a long time, but then found what I was looking for: An SVG version of the logo, which I was able to import into Sketchup.

After some fiddling, I was able to integrate the new logo into the existing ring.
There are some small errors in it, but Cura has no problems with them.

I integrated a normal version of the logo and an inverted version into the ring.
So, now seven coasters fit into the container.

Speaking of which... I didn't like the container for the coasters either, as I would have had problems getting the last coasters out.
Why? The two "W" blocked my fingers when I pulled out the last coaster.

So I took the opportunity and worked one of the "W" openings into a "V".
This makes it easier to remove the coasters and the "VW" letters appeared on it.

I also joined the container to a solid body. I think it looks better, now.

That's all.
