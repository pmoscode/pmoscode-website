For my darling's birthday, I had a very special present in mind.
It should be something original and functional.

With the two specifications I started looking for inspiration.

Where? On the internet, of course. :)

After getting inspired enough, I came up with a wall clock.
I found a similar clock on the internet that I wanted to build with some modification.

It should consist of the following elements:

- A background plate
- The clock surface, which should be given a prominent structure
- Unsophisticated hour markers and
- Something special on the side

This prominent surface was now the challenge.
Fortunately, I found some old shelves from the previous owner of the house in my workshop.
These were in a very old condition - caused by the time and the weather.

To give the surface a prominent appearance, I also treated it with a wire brush.
This created a "canyon look" in the grain.
In the end, the clock surface consisted of a total of three boards, which I finally glued and oiled.

(1) The position of the hour markers was determined and marked with the aid of a circle.
In the center there was also the hole for the hands.

(2) The hour markings have been removed a few millimeters from the wood with a chisel.
This created layer was finally painted white.

(3) Because I got only hands which were painted black (except the one for the seconds, which was already red), I had to repaint them white.

(5) The background plate was a common multiplex plate, in which a hole was sawn in the place of the clockwork.

Spacers were glued between the surface of the clock and the background plate, which should provide an impression of depth.

(4) Finally, I saw out four hearts from plywood - two larger and two smaller ones - that were also glued to the surface of the clock, also with spacers.

So this little project was finished.

My darling was very happy about it ... :)
