A few month ago, I had an idea for a real cash register for children.

And of course this would be a nice project to get hands dirty in some hardware and software...

<!--more-->

...so, I started to think about: *What should be part of the cash register?*

By that thinking, I asked myself: _What parts belong to an actual cash register?_

So here are the parts:

- _Bar code scanner_
- _Receipt printer_
- _Cash register_
- _Credit card reader_

Now, where the hell should I get these parts from? Of course as cheap as possible... :)

Solution: Some kind of flea market. Or better: (in Germany) ebay-kleinanzeigen.de

So I found the first three parts. (I will introduce the parts in a later article)
The last one, I already owned. (Means: I owned a rfid reader, which is sufficient)

*Bar code scanner*

*Receipt printer*

*Cash register*

Now, I'm waiting to get the parts...

And, in the meantime I do some testing with my rfid reader...
